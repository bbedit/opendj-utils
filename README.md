opendj-utils
============

Some small utilities for the OpenDJ LDAP server.

* slowops - analyzes operation times in access logs
* decodecsn - decodes replication CSNs

Note these are all unofficial and not supported in any way by ForgeRock. If
they work and they're useful: great! If not, patches are welcome...
