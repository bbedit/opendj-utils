opendj-utils
============

Some small utilities for the [OpenDJ LDAP server](http://opendj.forgerock.org/).

* slowops - analyzes operation times in access logs
* decodecsn - decodes replication CSNs
* topology2dot - displays a replication topology in Graphviz DOT format

Ludovic Poitou has some tools on [github too!](/ludomp/opendj-utils)

Note these are all unofficial and not supported in any way by ForgeRock. If
they work and they're useful: great! If not, patches are welcome...
